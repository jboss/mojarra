/**
 * <p class="changed_added_2_2">When this annotation, along with {@code
 * javax.inject.Named} is found on a class, the runtime must place the
 * bean in a CDI scope such that it remains active as long as {@link
 * javax.faces.application.NavigationHandler#handleNavigation} does not
 * cause a navigation to a view with a viewId that is different than the
 * viewId of the current view. Any injections and notifications required
 * by CDI and the Java EE platform must occur as usual at the expected
 * time.</p>
 * 
 * <div class="changed_added_2_2">

 * <p>If <code>ProjectStage</code> is not
 * <code>ProjectStage.Production</code>, verify that the current {@link
 * javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot} does not have its {@code transient}
 * property set to {@code true}.  If so, add a <code>FacesMessage</code>
 * for the current {@code viewId} to the <code>FacesContext</code>
 * stating {@code @ViewScoped} beans cannot work if the view is marked
 * as transient.    Also log a <code>Level.WARNING</code> message to the 
 * log.  If <code>ProjectStage</code> <strong>is</strong>
 * <code>ProjectStage.Production</code>, do not do this
 * verification.</p>

 * <p>The bean must be stored in the map returned from 
 * {@link javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot#getViewMap(boolean)}.</p>

 * <p>Use of this annotation requires that any beans stored in view scope
 * must be serializable and proxyable as defined in the CDI specification.
 * </p>

 * <p>The runtime must ensure that any methods on the bean annotated
 * with {@code PostConstruct} or {@code PreDestroy} are called when the
 * scope begins and ends, respectively.  Two circumstances can cause the
 * scope to end.</p>

 * <ul>

 * <li><p>{@link javax.faces.context.FacesContext#setViewRoot} is called
 * with the new {@code UIViewRoot} being different than the current
 * one.</p></li>

 * <li><p>The session, that happened to be active when the bean was
 * created, expires.  If no session existed when the bean was created,
 * then this circumstance does not apply.</p></li>

 * </ul>

 * <p>In the session expiration case, the runtime must ensure that
 * {@link javax.faces.context.FacesContext#getCurrentInstance} returns a
 * valid instance if it is called during the processing of the
 * {@code @PreDestroy} annotated method.  The set of methods on {@code
 * FacesContext} that are valid to call in this circumstance is
 * identical to those documented as "valid to call this method during
 * application startup or shutdown". On the {@link
 * javax.faces.context.ExternalContext} returned from that {@code
 * FacesContext}, all of the methods documented as "valid to call this
 * method during application startup or shutdown" are valid to call.  In
 * addition, the method {@link
 * javax.faces.context.ExternalContext#getSessionMap} is also valid to
 * call.</p>
